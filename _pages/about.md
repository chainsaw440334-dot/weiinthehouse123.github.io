Zhou Wei is a graduate student at [School of Journalism and Communication, Nanjing University](http://jc.nju.edu.cn), lucky to be guided by her brilliant and kind supervisor, Professor Zhu Jiangli. This website is the brainchild of her journey through the _Introduction to Computational Communication course. Building a site from scratch was a completely new and daunting challenge for her. She stumbled at least three times (maybe more!), but thanks to her optimism, resilience, and a stubborn refusal to give up, she finally made it here! She adores Nanjing Universityâ€”the stimulating courses, the inspiring faculty, and their enlightening ideas. They motivate her to grow into a better and kinder person herself. Now, back to business! This little corner of the internet will document her adventures in computational communication, along with her thoughts, snippets of life, and personal growth.
